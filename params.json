This is currently a Linux-only project. baldr is an extension for the MORSE robotics simulator: https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse/.\r\n\r\nCheck out baldr's Wiki (https://github.com/motet/baldr/wiki) for developer information!\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://i58.tinypic.com/wrki88.jpg)\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://i61.tinypic.com/rr2s00.jpg)\r\n\r\n![alt tag](http://s21.postimg.org/6oxlsg3l3/Screenshot_from_2015_06_18_22_00_34.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Install the required Python libraries if you don't already have them (the MORSE robotics simulator requires Python3):\r\n\t`$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-scipy python3-numpy python3-matplotlib`\r\n\r\n2. Install MORSE with the command:\r\n\t`$ sudo apt-get install morse-simulator.`\r\n\tIf you don't already have Blender, this should install it automatically. Use the default settings (ie. make the default folder for simulation files your Home folder).\r\n\r\n3. You need to create a simulation called \"baldr\" in MORSE. Do this with the command:\r\n\t`$ morse create baldr`.\r\n\tThis will create a folder in your Home directory called ~/baldr with some MORSE simulation files in it, and it will also add a line to the ~/.morse/config file to identify the name \"baldr\" as a MORSE simulation.\r\n\r\n4. Clone this repository and replace all the contents of the new ~/baldr folder with the contents of the repository you just downloaded.\r\n\r\n5. To run the MORSE component of the simulator, use the command:\r\n\t`$ morse run baldr`\r\n\r\n6. To run the GUI component of the simulator, use the command:\r\n\t`$ python3 ~/baldr/scripts/main.py`\r\n","google":"UA-64311031-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
